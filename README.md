# 🛒 ShopCard

A front-end e-commerce website clone built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, inspired by Amazon.
This project is developed as a learning project to practice **UI design**, **responsive layouts**, and **front-end development** concepts.

The **ShopCard** project is a **static website** that mimics the look and feel of a modern online shopping platform.
It is **not connected to any backend or database**, but it provides a great foundation for understanding:

* How large e-commerce platforms structure their UI
* How to design **responsive navigation bars, product sections, and footers**
* How to use **flexbox, grid, and CSS utilities** to build layouts
* How JavaScript can add **basic interactivity**

This project is ideal for **beginners in web development** who want to sharpen their front-end skills.
